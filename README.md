# Caesar Cipher using Ruby
**by M. Bambalan**

**Technologies used:**
- Ruby

## Description
From Wikipedia:
> In cryptography, a **Caesar cipher**, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Dev's Reflection
I started learning how to program using `ruby`! 

`Ruby` is a very simple to read. some of its syntax and concepts are similar to Javascipt. So, learning its basics was smooth sailing! But there are additional methods that made coding with Ruby so much simpler than JS, like the `#between?` method. *I will continue studying `Ruby`!*
